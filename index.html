      <h3>Hudde Bodega           Last Year 2021-2022</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> It was a shop where you could buy things and I was working at the cash register. It did not require real money but fake which are called Hudde bucks. If you worked hard and followed the rules, you got a lot of them. They are used for shopping and trips. In my store I got paid with those too becaue you needed at least 500 for some trips. It was a great experience because I got a lot of snacks for free and I was the teacher's favorite worker.  </li>

          <li> Project was supposed to be finished in a certain time and if you did not complete it in that time then you would not get extra time. It was a one hour lab. Taking notes and completing the activity at the same time was a challenge.</li>
